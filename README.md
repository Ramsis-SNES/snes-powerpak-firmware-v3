# SNES PowerPak Firmware v3 "MUFASA"

This is an unofficial firmware for RetroUSB's [SNES PowerPak](http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&products_id=84) flash cart.

It offers several advantages over the stock v1.0X firmware:
* Up to 56 characters per filename are displayed on the screen thanks to the SNES's horizontal hi-res mode.
* A settings menu lets you change the PowerPak's configuration at any time.
* The SPC player actually works. Also, you can return to the file browser instantly to play another song.
* A more stable user interface with more intuitive joypad button mapping.
* Full theme support, i.e. with a bit of skill, you can customize the UI to your own liking. Or, just use any of the themes supplied with this release.
* Better performance thanks to a unified software design that takes advantage of the SNES's 16-bit capabilities.
* In-system update flashing.
* ... and more (e.g. much faster scrolling, page-by-page navigation, transparency and color gradient effects, context-sensitive on-screen help, more verbose system information ...)
