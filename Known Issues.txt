   KNOWN ISSUES IN V3.00:
______________________________________________________________________

- The game "Pilotwings" doesn't work even with a DSP1 chip installed in your PowerPak. This bug has been known since v1.0X. It's most likely related to there being different hardware revisions of the chip and/or the PowerPak hardware not supporting LoROM DSP1 games properly. Note that you might get the game to run using a very small CF card (<500 MB), but in effect, this is a pure matter of luck.

- The game "Star Ocean" (uncompressed 96 Mbit version) doesn't offer you to save your SRAM after playing. This can be fixed by patching your ROM's internal header. Check the posting by shadowkn55 in the nesdev forum thread (http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=53414#p53414) or contact me for details.

- When playing an SPC file (esp. tunes from later SquareSoft games), audio artifacts/glitches may occur. The exact cause of this issue is unknown and subject to current investigations.

- On SNES consoles with CPU v02/PPU1 v01/PPU2 v01 (in short, 2/1/1) chipset, the SDRAM check may report errors although loading and playing ROMs works just fine (i.e. hardware-wise, SDRAM is OK). This is most likely caused by a PowerPak hardware design flaw -- in any case, there is no known fix or workaround on the software side. Consoles with 1/1/1, 2/1/2, or 2/1/3 chipsets don't seem to be affected though.

- The SPC player neither reads nor displays extended ID666 tags.

- The file browser doesn't display entries in alphabetical order, but instead the way the filesystem organizes files on the CF card. If it really bothers you, please consider using drive-sorting software after loading your card with ROMs and savegames (although this is neither recommended nor tested).
