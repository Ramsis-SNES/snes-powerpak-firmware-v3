   KNOWN ISSUES EXCLUSIVE TO (OR NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL) V3.XX:
______________________________________________________________________

- On SNES consoles with CPU v02/PPU1 v01/PPU2 v01 (in short, 2/1/1) chipset, the SDRAM check may report errors although loading and playing ROMs works just fine (i.e. hardware-wise, SDRAM is most likely OK). This may be caused by a hardware design flaw of the PowerPak, but this is pure speculation. In any case, there is no known fix/workaround on the SNES software side. Consoles with 1/1/1, 2/1/2, or 2/1/3 chipsets don't seem to be affected.

- When playing an SPC file (esp. songs from later SquareSoft games), audio artifacts/glitches may occur. Rarely, a file might even seem to load okay but no sound will be played at all. The exact cause of this issue is unknown and subject to ongoing investigations. Don't expect a fix anytime soon, though.



   KNOWN ISSUES SINCE V1.0X:
______________________________________________________________________

- The SPC player neither reads nor displays extended ID666 tags.

- The file browser doesn't display entries in alphabetical order, but instead the way the filesystem organizes files on the CF card. If it really bothers you, please consider using drive-sorting software after loading your card with ROMs and savegames (although this is neither recommended nor tested).

- ChimeraHardline's fan translation of the game "Fire Emblem Thracia 776" doesn't work. The translation expands the ROM to 64 Mbits and uses a special ExLoROM mapping, which the original SNES PowerPak creator implemented but never actually bothered to test (and it doesn't work). Unfortunately, SNES PowerPak hardware register documentation is pretty much non-existent (as is the original Verilog/VHDL source for the FPGA file), so there's currently no hope of getting this game to run on the PowerPak, ever.

- The game "Pilotwings" might not work even with a DSP1 chip installed in your PowerPak. This is most likely related to there being different hardware revisions of the chip and/or the PowerPak hardware not supporting LoROM DSP1 games properly. Note that I have actually gotten the game to run in the past using a very small CF card (<500 MB), but in practice, getting it to boot at all seems to be a pure matter of luck.

- The game "Star Ocean" (uncompressed 96 Mbit version) doesn't offer you to save your SRAM after playing. This can be fixed by patching/editing the ROM's internal header.
